 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union ter ritory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disab ility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist  and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district l evel estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/unio n territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objectiv e of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Be sides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules  - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; an d the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual beha viour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vi tamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully  rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or mor e 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Tripura . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  
was conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019  by Indian Institute of Health Management Research 
(IIHMR) . Information was gathered from 7,209 households, 7,314 women, and 990  men. Fact sheets for each 
district in Tripura  are also available separately.

Note: Major  indicators are highlighted in grey. The decrease in health insurance/financing scheme (Indicator 12) and 4 or more antenatal care visits (Indicator 41) in Tripura should be 
interpreted with caution. The decline may be due to many factors, including compos itional changes of the population in the newly formed districts.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wi sh to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether (limiting). 
Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become  pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to become 
pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are consi dered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted bir th and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need for spacing 
plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current  users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union  territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, d isability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of w aist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distri ct level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/ union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time . Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva  Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage o f mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dhalai . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  
was conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019 by Indian Institute of Health Manage ment Research 
(IIHMR) . In Dhalai , information was gathered from 920 households, 979 women, and 130 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spac ing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant,  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for u p to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwan ted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily plan ning is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union  territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, d isability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of w aist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distri ct level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/ union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. N FHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wi th an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marri age, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of ch ildren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heig ht, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to prov ide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled ou t and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenata l care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Gomati . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  was 
conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019 by Indian Institute of Health Management Research 
(IIHMR) . In Gomati , information was gathered from 889 households, 851 women, and 109 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contr aception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do  not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years follow ing an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting . 
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who  are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrace ption, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up  to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unm et need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each s tate/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool ed ucation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measur ement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers  who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  North Tripura . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  was 
conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019 by Indian Institute of Health Management Research  
(IIHMR) . In North Tripura , information was gathered from 909 households, 1,039  women, and 125 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each s tate/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool ed ucation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measur ement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Sepahijala . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  was 
conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019 by Indian Institute of Health Management Research 
(IIHMR) . In Sepahijala , information was gathered from 888 households, 892 women, and 121 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each s tate/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool ed ucation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measur ement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  South Tripura . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  was 
conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019 by Indian Institute of Health Management Research 
(IIHMR ). In South Tripura , information was gathered from 888 households, 866 women, and 96 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpa rtum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unm et need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum  of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each s tate/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool ed ucation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measur ement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  West Tripura . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Tripura  was 
conducted from 4 July, 2019 to 10  November, 2019 by Indian Institute of Health Management Research  
(IIHMR) . In West Tripura , information was gathered from 903 households, 865 women, and 151 men.
