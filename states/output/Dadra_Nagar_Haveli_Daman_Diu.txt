 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expand ed to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/un ion territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dadra & Nagar Hav eli and Daman & 
Diu. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Dadra & Nagar Hav eli and Daman & Diu  was conducted from 27 July, 2019 to 30  
November, 2019  by Centre for Operations Research and Training (CORT) . Information was gathered from 
2,676  households, 2,713  women, and 427 men. Fact sheets for each district in Dadra & Nagar Ha veli and 
Daman & Diu  are also available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specif ically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant . 
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
  Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are cla ssified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectab les, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health,  and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has a lso been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domes tic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the n odal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dadra & Nagar Hav eli. NFHS -5 fieldwork 
for Dadra  & Nagar Hav eli and Daman & Diu  was conducted from 27 July, 2019 to 30  November, 2019 by 
Centre for Operations Research and Training (CORT) . In Dadra & Nagar Hav eli, information was gathered 
from 914 households, 1,002 women, and 174 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specif ically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not u sing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need b ecause they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for  India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, suc h as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union  territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are a vailable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to con duct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the healt h sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three  years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, r eproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health is sues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for H bA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (perc entage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Daman . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Dadra  & 
Nagar Hav eli and Daman & Diu  was conducted from 27 July, 2019 to 30  November, 2019 by Centre for 
Operations Research and Training (CORT) . In Daman , information was gathered from 851 households, 733 
women, and 152  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
becom e pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usin g contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic  for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing p lus unmet need for limiting.

specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of e ssential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the h ousehold and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nut rition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women a ge 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory test ing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshi t Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (pe rcentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Diu. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Dadra  & Nagar 
Haveli and Daman & Diu  was conducted from 27 July, 2019 to 30  November, 2019 by Centre for Operations 
Research and Training (CORT) . In Diu, information was gathered from 911 households, 978 women, and 
101  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically , women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not us ing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need be cause they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.
