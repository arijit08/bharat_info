 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, di sability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of wa ist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distric t level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/u nion territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Gujarat . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat  
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November, 2019  by Centre for Operatio ns Research and Training 
(CORT) and TALEEM Research Foundation . Information was gathered from 29,368  households, 33,343  
women, and 5,351  men. Fact sheets for each district in Gujarat  are also available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to h ave unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed p regnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
  Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each stat e/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool educa tion, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Ahmedabad . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Ahmedabad , information was gathered from 906 households, 1,010  women, and 155 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are conside red to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mi stimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Amreli . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Amreli , information was gathered from 870 households, 936 women, and 127 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women wh o are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrace ption, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant . 
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up  to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unm et need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Anand . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Anand , 
information was gathered from 870 households, 914 women, and 163 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Aravali . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Aravali , 
information was gathered from 901 households, 1,078  women, and 187 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Banas kantha . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Gujarat was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operati ons Research and 
Training  (CORT) . In Banas kantha , information was gathered from 889 households, 1,049  women, and 157 
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usin g contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum  of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Bharuch . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Bharuch , information was gathered from 856 households, 919 women, and 124 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to  
become pregnant . 
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becomin g pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund hav e no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Bhavnagar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Bhavnagar , information was gathered from 871 households, 950 women, and 145 men.

5Locally prepared napkins, sanitary napkins, tampons, and menstrual cups are considered to be hygienic methods of protection.  
6Any method includes other methods that are not shown separately; Any modern method includ es other modern methods that are not shown separately.  
7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnan t with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrace ption, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they a re not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mi stimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Chhota  Udaipur. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by  TALEEM Research Foundation . In Chhota  Udaipur, 
information was gathered from 896 households, 1,035  women, and 173 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Dahod. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Dahod, 
information was gathered from 899 households, 1,221 women, and 158 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers  to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altoge ther 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant,  not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant . 
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Devbhumi Dwarka . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Guja rat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operatio ns Research and Training 
(CORT). In Devbhumi Dwarka , information was gathered from 915 households, 1,170  women, and 198 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracepti on, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usi ng contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to  two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Gir Somnath . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Gir Somnath , information was gathered from 900 households, 1,158  women, and 185 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for Jamnagar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operatio ns Research and Training 
(CORT). In Jamnagar , information was gathered from 920 households, 1,042  women, and 165 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracepti on, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usi ng contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to  two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Junagadh . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operati ons Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Junagadh , information was gathered from 886 households, 963 women, and 164 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnan t with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrace ption, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Kheda . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was co nducted 
from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Kheda , information was 
gathered from 890 households, 1,029 women, and 183 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each stat e/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool educa tion, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Mahes ana. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Mahes ana, 
information was gathered from 839 households, 883 women, and 136 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically , women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not us ing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need be cause they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Mahisagar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Mahisagar , 
information was gathered from 899 households, 1,017  women, and 168 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are conside red to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mi stimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at r isk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).

5Locally prepared napkins, sanitary napkins, tampons, and menstrual cups are considered to be hygienic methods of protection.  
6Any method includes other methods that are not shown separately; Any modern method includes other modern methods that are not  shown separately.  
7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracepti on, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usi ng contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to  two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Narmada . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Narmada , 
information was gathered from 904 households, 1,021  women, and 155 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Navsari . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Navsari , 
information was gathered from 893 households, 991 women, and 162 men.

become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are cla ssified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Panch mahal. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Panch mahal, 
information was gathered from 908 households, 1,101  women, and 196 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracepti on, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usi ng contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to  two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Patan . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Patan , information was gathered from 904 households, 1,011  women, and 169 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pre gnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant,  not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women wh o are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrace ption, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up  to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unm et need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Rajkot . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was c onducted 
from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training (CORT) . In 
Rajkot , information was gathered from 882 households, 979 women, and 159 men

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Sabar kantha . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Sabar kantha , 
information was gathered from 892 households, 1,018  women, and 152 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Surat . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Surat , 
information was gathered from 902 households, 986 women, and 195 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are conside red to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant . 
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not us ing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need be cause they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Surendranagar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujara t was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by Centre for Operations Research and Training 
(CORT) . In Surendranagar , information was gathered from 869 households, 931 women, and 143 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnan t with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrace ption, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they a re not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are con sidered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant . 
   · Pregnant with a  mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, a nd want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not a t risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for The Dangs . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In The Dangs , 
information was gathered from 897 households, 901 women, and 130 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Vadodara . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat was 
conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Vadodara , 
information was gathered from 855 households, 894 women, and 167 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are con sidered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV te sting has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s backgroun d and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, design ated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this  area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new progr ammes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).  In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insu rance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristic s, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his numb er of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements  of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested  to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any  usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Valsad . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Gujarat 
was conducted from 23 June, 2019 to 30 November , 2019 by TALEEM Research Foundation . In Valsad , 
information was gathered from 882 households, 1,031  women, and 159 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.
