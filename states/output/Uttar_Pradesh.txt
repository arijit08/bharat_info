State Fact Sheet 
Uttar Pradesh  
Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. Howev er, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s  background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Ind ia, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issu es in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for  new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewi ng (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; h ealth insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s char acteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage , his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; me asurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were  requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample  size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households w ith any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Uttar Pradesh . Due to th e Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March  2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS) and Research and Development Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd . Information was gathered from 
70,710 households,  93,124  women,  and 12,043  men. Fact sheets for each district in Uttar Pradesh  are also 
available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to f ecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed  birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amen orrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for s pacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Agra . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Agra , information was gathered from 944 households, 1,226 women, and 159 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Aligarh . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Aligarh , information was gathered from 883 households, 1,073 women, and 145 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were no t fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4  or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Amethi . Due to the Covid -19 situation and the 
imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Amethi , information was gathered from 906 households, 1,255  women, and 124  men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Auraiya . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy  of Management Studies (AMS) . 
In Auraiya , information was gathered from 977 households, 1,309 women, and 166 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Azamgarh . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Azamgarh , information was gathered from 902 households, 1,354 women, and 146 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bahraich . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Bahraich , information was gathered from 956 households, 1,128 women, and 129 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Ballia . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Ballia , information was gathered from 959 households, 1,254 women, and 144 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Balrampur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Balrampur , information was gathered from 979 households, 1,235 women, and 141 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Banda . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in  two parts. NFHS -

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Barabanki . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducte d in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Barabanki , information was gathered from 967 households, 1,186 women, and 184  men.

become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union te rritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are avai lable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduc t NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health s ector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential ser vices.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and  visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three ye ars preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, repr oductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issue s, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 yea rs and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1 c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva A bhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bareilly . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Bareilly , information was gathered from 874 households, 1,088 women, and 99 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Basti . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Basti , information was gathered from 979 households, 1,362 women, and 147 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were no t fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4  or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bijnor . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Bijnor , information was gathered from 949 households, 1,348 women, and 178 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to  fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are: 
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracepti on, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usi ng contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to  two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union te rritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are avai lable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduc t NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health s ector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential ser vices.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and  visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three ye ars preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, repr oductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issue s, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 yea rs and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1 c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva A bhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bulandshahr . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development 
Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Bulandshahr , information was gathered from 924 households, 1,105 women, and

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Chandauli . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Chandauli , information was gathered from 950 households, 1,272 women, and 141 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Chitrakoot . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Chitrakoot , information was gathered from 985 households, 1,176 women, and 173 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Deoria . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Deoria , information was gathered from 949 households, 1,317 women, and 157 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Etah. Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Development Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In 
Etah, information was gathered from 953 households, 1,267 women, and 179 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Etawah . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Etawah , information was gathered from 978 households, 1,225 women, and 183  men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Faizabad . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Faizabad , information was gathered from 914 households, 1,213 women, and 137 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to  fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Farrukhabad . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conduc ted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development 
Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Farrukhabad , information was gathered from 969 households, 1,276 women, and 
175 men.

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Firozabad . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducte d in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Firozabad , information was gathered from 951 households, 1,178 women, and 181 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sex ual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family We lfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assi sted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sa nitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, in cluding the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s c haracteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin  levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addi tion, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UT s may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (p ercentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Gautam Buddha Nagar . Due to the 
Covid -19 situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted 
in two parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 
prior to the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and 
Development Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Gautam Buddha Nagar , information was gathered from 713 
households, 863 women, and 95 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Ghaziabad . Due to the Covid -19 situation and the 
imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Ghaziabad , information was gathered from 716 households, 805 women, and 76 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they ar e: 
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoei c for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with a n unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Gonda . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Gonda , information was gathered from 972 households, 1,292 women, and 152 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Gorakhpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Gorakhpur , information was gathered from 958 households, 1,360 women, and 135 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Hamirpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted  in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Hamirpur , information was gathered from 980 households, 1,389 women, and 206  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Hapur . Due to the Covid -19 situation and the 
imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar  Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI)

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are: 
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracepti on, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usi ng contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to  two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union te rritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are avai lable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduc t NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health s ector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential ser vices.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and  visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three ye ars preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, repr oductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issue s, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 yea rs and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1 c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva A bhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Hardoi . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in tw o parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Hardoi , information was gathered from 983 households, 1,206 women, and 188 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jalaun . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted i n two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Jalaun , information was gathered from 978 households, 1,373 women, and 198 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jaunpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Jaunpur , information was gathered from 977 households, 1,561 women, and 176 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jhansi . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted i n two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Jhansi , information was gathered from 984 households, 1,326 women, and 229  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted  Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanita tion, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, includ ing the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s chara cteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin lev els 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition , women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs ma y have

   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kannauj . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Kannauj , information was gathered from 989 households, 1,317 women, and 198 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kanpur Dehat . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was condu cted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Kanpur Dehat , information was gathered from 979 households, 1,213 women, and 144
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to  fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kanpur Nagar . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was condu cted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Kanpur Nagar , information was gathered from 980 households, 1,150 women, and 177 
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kanshiram Nagar . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development 
Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Kanshiram Nagar , information was gathered from 950 households, 1,143 women,

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kaushambi . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Kaushambi , information was  gathered from 914 households, 1,100 women, and 140 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund wome n who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kheri . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in  two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Kheri , information was gathered from 971 households, 1,280 women, and 169 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kushinagar . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Kushinagar , information was gath ered from 946 households, 1,312 women, and 138 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Lalitpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted  in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Lalitpur , information was gathered from 982 households, 1,484 women, and 230 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union te rritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are avai lable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduc t NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health s ector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential ser vices.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and  visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three ye ars preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, repr oductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issue s, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 yea rs and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1 c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva A bhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mahamaya Nagar . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conduct ed in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development 
Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Mahamaya Nagar , information was gathered from 946 households, 1,234 women, 
and 146 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Maharajganj . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts.  NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Maharajganj , information was gathere d from 946 households, 1,316 women, and 120 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mahoba . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted i n two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Mahoba , information was gathered from 978 households, 1,347 women, and 226  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mainpuri . Due to the Covid -19 situation

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mathura . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Mathura , information was gathered from 935 households, 1,175  women, and 162 men.

become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mau. Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Mau, information was gathered from 960 households, 1,310 women, and 189 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Meerut . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Meerut , information was gathered from 918 households, 1,212 women, and 169 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mirzapur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Mirzapur , information was gathered from 942 households, 1,176 women, and 147 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they ar e: 
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoei c for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with a n unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Muzaffarnagar . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Muzaffarnagar , information was gathered from 932 households, 1,201 women, and 179  men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Pilibhit . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Pilibhit , information was gathered from 898 households, 1,040 women, and 142 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Pratapgarh . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Pratapgarh , information was gathered from 916 households, 1,267 women, and 96 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to  fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Rae Bareli . Due to the Covid -19 situation and the 
imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Rae Bareli , information was gathered from 985 households, 1,258  women, and 148 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Rampur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted i n two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI) 
Pvt. Ltd. In Rampur , information was gathered from 876 households, 1,092 women, and 145 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to  fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union te rritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are avai lable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduc t NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health s ector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential ser vices.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and  visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three ye ars preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, repr oductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issue s, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 yea rs and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1 c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva A bhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Saharanpur . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted i n two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development 
Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Saharanpur , information was gathered from 966 households, 1,318 women, and 
183  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoei c for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with a n unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to  include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union t erritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sant Kabeer Nagar . Due to the Covid -
19 situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Sant Kabeer  Nagar , information was gathered from 958 households, 1,266 women, and 
120 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and meth ods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfar e, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfa re and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in iden tifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted  Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanita tion, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, includ ing the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s chara cteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin lev els 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition , women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs ma y have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (perce ntage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sant Ravidas Nagar  (Bhadohi ). Due to 
the Covid -19 situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was 
conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st 
March 2020 prior to the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy 
of Management Studies (AMS). In Sant Ravidas Nagar  (Bhadohi ), information was gathered from 884 
households, 1,352 women, and 118 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Shahjahanpur . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was condu cted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development 
Initiative (RDI) Pvt. Ltd. In Shahjahanpur , information was gathered from 980 households, 1,286 women, and 
220  men.

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were no t fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4  or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Shamli . Due to the Covid -19 situation and the 
imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Research and Development Initiative (RDI)

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are: 
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Shravasti . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Shravasti , information was gathered from 974 households, 1,233 women, and 154 men.

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Siddharthnagar . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to 
the lockdown and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management 
Studies (AMS). In Siddharthnagar , information was gathered from 949 households, 1,396 women, and 127
men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union te rritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are avai lable only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduc t NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health s ector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential ser vices.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and  visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three ye ars preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, repr oductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issue s, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 yea rs and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1 c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva A bhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sitapur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in t wo parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Sitapur , information was gathered from 960 households, 1,212 women, and 148 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sonbhadra . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Sonbhadra , information was gathered from 952 households, 1,158 women, and 168 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are: 
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to in clude measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union terr itory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matrit va Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage  of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Unnao . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in  two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Unnao , information was gathered from 984 households, 1,128 women, and 152 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Varanasi . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts. NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Uttar Pradesh was conducted from 13th January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown 
and from 28th November 2020 to 19th April 2021 post lockdown by Academy of Management Studies (AMS). 
In Varanasi , information was gathered from 936 households, 1,403 women, and 195 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogethe r 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.
