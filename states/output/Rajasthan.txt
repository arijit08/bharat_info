Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Rajasthan . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan  was conducted from 2nd January 2020  to 21st March 2020  prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR) . Information was gathered fro m 31,817  households, 42,990  women, and 6,353  men. Fact 
sheets for each district in Rajasthan  are also available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wis h to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are consid ered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birt h and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Ajmer . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Ajmer , information was gathered from 894 households, 1,082 women, and 146 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Alwar . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Alwar , information was gathered from 935 households, 1,182 women, and 152 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Banswara . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Banswara , information was gathered from 976 households, 1,172 women, and 170
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Baran . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Baran , information was gathered from 985 households, 1,301 women, and 227  men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, dis ability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Barmer . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Barmer , information was gathered from 973 households, 1,621 women, and 237  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bharatpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Bharatpur , information was gathered from 950 households, 1,225 women, and 168
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bikaner . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Bikaner , information was gathered from 966 households, 1,473 women, and 241  men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bundi . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Bundi , information was gathered from 984 households, 1,253 women, and 190 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers t o fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altoget her 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, n ot using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they wa nt to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistim ed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum am enorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Chittaurgarh . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts.  NFHS -5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the 
lockdown and from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR).  In Chittaurgarh , information was gathered from 972 households, 1,090 
women, and 141 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Churu . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dausa . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Dausa , information was gathered from 982 households, 1,332 women, and 208  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dhaulpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Dhaulpur , information was gathered from 974 households, 1,220 women, and 187 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dungarpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Dungarpur , information was gathered from 972 households, 1,359 women, and 223
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were no t fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4  or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Ganganagar . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts.  NFHS -5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the 
lockdown and from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR).  In Ganganagar , information was gathered from 985 households, 1,409 
women, and 223  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, dis ability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jaipur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Jaipur , information was gathered from 957 households, 1,241 women, and 198 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jaisalmer . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Jaisalmer , information was gathered from 979 households, 1,537 women, and 237
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jalor . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Jalor , information was gathered f rom 927 households, 1,318 women, and 193  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages

collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the

topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles,

7Unmet need for family planning refers t o fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altoget her 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, n ot using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they wa nt to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistim ed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum am enorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were no t fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4  or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jhunjhunun . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts.  NFHS -5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the 
lockdown and from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR).  In Jhunjhunun , information was gathered from 976 households, 1,388 
women, and 186 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jodhpur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Jodhpur , information was gathered from 978 households, 1,535 women, and 239  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Karauli . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Karauli , information was gathered from 979 households, 1,167 women, and 176 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kota. Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Kota, information was gathered from 979 households, 1,278 women, and 158 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Pali. Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Pali, information was gathered from 929 households, 1,236 women, and 159 men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were no t fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4  or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Pratapgarh . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Pratapgarh , information was gathered from 978 households, 1,199 women, and 177
men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Rajsamand . Due to the Covid -19 
situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two 
parts.  NFHS -5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the 
lockdown and from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR).  In Rajsamand , information was gathered from 919 households, 1,153 
women, and 152 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers t o fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altoget her 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, n ot using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they wa nt to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistim ed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum am enorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sikar . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Sikar , information was gathered from 971 households, 1,458 women, and 203  men.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, dis ability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sirohi . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Sirohi , information was gathered from 951 households, 1,304 women, and 190 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Tonk . Due to the Covid -19 situation and 
the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -5 
fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Tonk , information was gathered from 966 households, 1,240 women, and 187 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019-21  (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also 
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. 
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and distr ict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state /union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over tim e. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sche dules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in  the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
surve y; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual  behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards ge nder roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 ye ars; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, a nd Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat  AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Udaipur . Due to the Covid -19 situation 
and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS -5 fieldwork in phase 2 States/UTs was conducted in two parts.  NFHS -
5 fieldwork for Rajasthan was conducted from 2nd January 2020 to 21st March 2020 prior to the lockdown and 
from 10th December 2020 to  1st March 2021 post lockdown by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR).  In Udaipur , information was gathered from 961 households, 1,277 women, and 191 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.
