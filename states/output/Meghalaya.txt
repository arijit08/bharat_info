 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT ). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, acc ess to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Meghalaya . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Meghalaya  was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  Nove mber, 2019  by IQVIA Consulting and  Information 
Services India Pvt. Ltd . Information was gathered from 10,148 households, 13,089 women, and 1,824  men. 
Fact sheets for each district in Meghalaya  are also available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altoget her 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are u nsure if or when they w ant to become 
pregnant.  
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
  Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of b ecoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  East Garo Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services  India 
Pvt. Ltd . In East Garo Hills , information was gathered from 919 households, 1,280 women, and 198  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usin g contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum  of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  East Ja intia Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services India 
Pvt. Ltd . In East Ja intia Hills , information was gathered from 924 households, 1,311  women, and 200  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two year s, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limit ing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are conside red to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not us ing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  North Garo Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services India 
Pvt. Ltd . In North Garo Hills , information was gathered from 923 households, 1,283  women, and 180  men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union te rritory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disa bility, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of wais t and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva  Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage o f mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Ribhoi . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services India 
Pvt. Ltd . In Ribhoi , information was gathered from 927 households, 1,238 women, and 145 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva  Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage o f mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  South  Garo Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Meghalaya  was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Information 
Services India Pvt. Ltd . In South Garo Hills , information was gathered from 921 households, 1,088 women, 
and 143  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are conside red to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mis timed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and w ant no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include meas urement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has m ade over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors w ho stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years precedi ng the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive he alth, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitude s towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usin g contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum  of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for I ndia and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to  include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union t erritory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to co nduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the heal th sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential  services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household  and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the thre e years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health i ssues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (perc entage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  South West Khasi Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Meghalaya  was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation

   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not usin g contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet n eed for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for West Garo Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services  India 
Pvt. Ltd . In West Garo Hills , information was gathered from 923 households, 1,090 women, and 158  men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  West Jaintia Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services India 
Pvt. Ltd . In West Jaintia Hills , information was gathered from 924 households, 1,172  women, and 155  men.

6Any method includes other methods that are not shown separately; Any modern method includes other modern methods that are not  shown separately.  
7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and eithe r do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contracept ion. 
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum  of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan  (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mother s who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  West Khasi Hills . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Meghalaya  
was conducted from 8 July, 2019 to 15  November, 2019 by IQVIA Consulting and Info rmation Services India

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether 
(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet need 
for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.
