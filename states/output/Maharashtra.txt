 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hi p 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level es timates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union terri tory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of ea ch successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides p roviding evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Hous ehold, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the househo ld the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the o wnership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blo od pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled  out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
anten atal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Maharashtra . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR)  and TRIOs Development Support (P) Ltd . Information was gathered from 
31,643 households, 33,755 women, and 5,497  men. Fact sheets for each district in Maharashtra  are also 
available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wis h to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or w hen they want to 
become pregnant . 
· Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
  Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
· At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
· Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
· Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years followi ng an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state /union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool educat ion, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (P MSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers w ho received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Ahmednagar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Ahmednagar , information was gathered from 883 households, 993 
women, and 139  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considere d to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not us ing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need be cause they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. N FHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wi th an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marri age, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of ch ildren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heig ht, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to prov ide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual mem ber covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Akola . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  
was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) Ltd . In Akola , 
information was gathered from 926 households, 1,098 women, and 202  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, wo men are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not us ing contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need be cause they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marri age, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of ch ildren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heig ht, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to prov ide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual mem ber covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who ar e not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraceptio n, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state /union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool educat ion, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (P MSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers w ho received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Aurangabad . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Aurangabad , information was gathered from 875 households, 1,011 women, and 147 men.

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming  pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or w hen they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bhandara . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Bhandara , information was gathered from 918 households, 920 women, and 152 men.

become pre gnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant,  not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Bid. NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  
was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) Ltd . In Bid, 
information was gathered from 877 households, 864 women, and 146  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund wome n who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using cont raception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers  who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Buldana . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Buldana , information was gathered from 931 households, 1,055 women, and 189 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop chi ldbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of bec oming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure i f or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years f ollowing a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state /union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool educat ion, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (P MSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers w ho received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Chandrapur . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Chandrapur , information was gathered from 922 households, 965 women, and 175 men.

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming  pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or w hen they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Dhule . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Dhule , information was gathered from 838 households, 883 women, and 
137  men.

7Unmet need for family plan ning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbe aring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becomin g pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or  when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Gadchiroli . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Gadchiroli , information was gathered from 921 households, 915 women, and 164 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Gondiya . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Gondiya , information was gathered from 915 households, 938 women, and 167 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracept ion, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not us ing contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up t o two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet  need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Hingoli . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Hingoli , information was gathered from 907 households, 1,121 women, and 173 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan ( PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jalgaon . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management  Research (IIHMR) . In Jalgaon , information was gathered from 842 households, 881 women, 
and 155  men.

7Unmet need for family plan ning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbe aring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becomin g pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or  when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Jalna . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  
was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) Ltd . In Jalna , 
information was gathered from 863 households, 937 women, and 145 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Kolhapur . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Kolhapur , information was gathered from 887 households, 986 women, 
and 150 men.

   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Latur . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  
was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) Ltd . In Latur , 
information was gathered from 906 households, 1,006 women, and 160  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as presch ool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mumbai Suburban . NFHS -5 fieldwork 
for Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Mumbai Suburban , information was gathered from 635 households, 552 
women, and 64 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop  childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsu re if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they ar e: 
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan ( PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Mumbai . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Mumbai , information was gathered from 826 households, 779 women, 
and 127  men.

7Unmet need for family pl anning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop child bearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becom ing pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance

topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contracept ion, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not us ing contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up t o two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet  need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Nanded . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Nanded , information was gathered from 908 households, 1,026 women, and 164 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated  the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. N FHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wi th an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marri age, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of ch ildren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heig ht, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to prov ide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual mem ber covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Nandurbar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Nandurbar, i nformation was gathered from 897 households, 1,040 
women, and 171  men.

become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are : 
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are c lassified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Nashik . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Nashik , information was gathered from 860 households, 1,023 women, 
and 155 men.

7Unmet need for family plan ning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbe aring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becomin g pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or  when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/un ion territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education , disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and di strict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the st ate/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey S chedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed  in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sex ual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards  gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites , and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were n ot fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Osmanabad . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Osmanabad , information was gathered from 919 households, 916 
women, and 147  men.

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming  pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or w hen they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Palghar . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  was 
conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health Management Research 
(IIHMR) . In Palghar , information was gathered from 890 households, 941 women, and 131 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women wh o are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contrac eption, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not  using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for u p to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus un met need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NF HS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes wit h an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the H ousehold Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marria ge, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of chi ldren, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of heigh t, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provi de a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at  the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual membe r covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Pune . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  
was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health Management 
Research (IIHMR) . In Pune , information was gathered from 786 households, 832 women, and 140  men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan ( PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Raigarh . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management  Research (IIHMR) . In Raigarh , information was gathered from 905 households, 918 women, 
and 172  men.

7Unmet need for family plann ing refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbea ring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming  pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or w hen they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan ( PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Ratnagiri . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Ratnagiri , information was gathered from 869 households, 807 women, 
and 127 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant wit h a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception , and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are no t at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and dist rict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the stat e/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over ti me. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sangli . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Sangli , information was gathered from 898 households, 966 women, and 
152 men.

7Unmet need for family plan ning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbe aring 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becomin g pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or  when they want to 
become pregnant . 
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS

and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main

Four Survey Sch edules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed i n the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexua l behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards g ender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not  fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Satara . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Satara , information was gathered from 896 households, 978 women, and 
149 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop chi ldbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of bec oming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure i f or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years f ollowing a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state /union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool educat ion, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available on ly at the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector ha s made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitor s who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years prec eding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive  health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attit udes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and m en age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malar ia parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (P MSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers w ho received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Sindhudurg . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management Research (IIHMR) . In Sindhudurg , information was gathered from 861 households, 722 women, 
and 115 men.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visito rs who stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years pre ceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductiv e health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, atti tudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, mala ria parasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan ( PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Solapur . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health 
Management  Research (IIHMR ). In Solapur , information was gathered from 912 households, 1,003 women, 
and 153 men.

7Unmet need for fam ily planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop  childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of  becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsur e if or wh en they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/uni on territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education,  disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of  waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA)  were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who re ceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators for  Thane . NFHS -5 fieldwork for Maharashtra  was 
conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by Indian Institute of Health Management Research 
(IIHMR) . In Thane , information was gathered from 755 households, 756 women, and 91 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who  are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they want to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic fo r up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an un wanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for fam ily planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.  
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5  years.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has mad e over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Wardha . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Wardha , information was gathered from 909 households, 925 women, and 158  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth  (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for sp acing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years,  or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpar tum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unme t need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool e ducation, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measu rement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT),  and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at  the state/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  Th e main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family

specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four S urvey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who  stayed in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding  the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive heal th, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men ag e 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria pa rasites, and Vitamin 
D3.  
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA ) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who r eceived 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Washim . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Washim , information was gathered from 903 households, 986 women, and 196  men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing 
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not  using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they w ant to 
become pregnant.  
   · Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.  
   Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:  
   · At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) chi ldren.  
   · Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.  
   · Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.  
  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

 Introduction  
The National Family Health Survey 2019 -20 (NFHS -5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on 
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/un ion territory (UT). Like NFHS -4, NFHS -5 also 
provides district -level estimates for many important indicators.  
The contents of NFHS -5 are similar to NFHS -4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS -5 includes 
some new topics, such as preschool education , disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing 
practices during menstruation , and methods and reasons for abortion.  The scope of clinical, anthropometric, 
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip 
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been 
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS -5 sample has been designed to provide 
national, state/union territory (UT) , and di strict level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. 
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS 
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the st ate/union territory (UT) 
and national level.  
As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the 
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS -5.  The main 
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high -quality data on health and family 
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS -5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining 
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of 
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS -5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area 
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.  
Four Survey S chedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages 
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was 
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed  in the household the previous night, 
as well as socio -economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance 
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the 
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of 
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and 
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sex ual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and 
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children, 
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards  gender roles, 
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels 
for children;  measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for 
women age 15 -49 years and men age 15 -54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for 
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few 
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites , and Vitamin 
D3. 
Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have 
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB -PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri 
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were n ot fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been 
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a 
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more 
antenatal care check -ups).  
This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for  Yavatmal . NFHS -5 fieldwork for 
Maharashtra  was conducted from 19 June , 2019 to 30  December , 2019  by TRIOs Development Support (P) 
Ltd. In Yavatmal , information was gathered from 913 households, 1,001 women, and 177 men.

  Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pr egnant. Unmet need for family planning  is the sum of unmet 
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.
