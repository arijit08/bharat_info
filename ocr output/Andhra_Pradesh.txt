Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman’s work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman's Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1ic, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Mantri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 41 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Andhra Pradesh. NFHS-5 fieldwork for
Andhra Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting
Pvt. Ltd. Information was gathered from 11,346 households, 10,975 women, and 1,558 men. Fact sheets for
each district in Andhra Pradesh are also available separately.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing
altogether (limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:
- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to
become pregnant.
- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.
- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.
Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:
- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.
- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.
- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.
Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet
need for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.
8Based on current users of female sterilization, IUD/PPIUD, injectables, and pills who started using that method in the past 5 years.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Anantapur. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Chittoor. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.
Ltd. In Chittoor, information was gathered from 865 households, 828 women, and 121 men.

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for East Godavari. NFHS-5 fieldwork for
Andhra Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting
Pvt. Ltd. In East Godavari, information was gathered from 888 households, 824 women, and 105 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Guntur. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.
Ltd. In Guntur, information was gathered from 851 households, 807 women, and 93 men.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Krishna. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.
Ltd. In Krishna, information was gathered from 865 households, 820 women, and 119 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Kurnool. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Prakasam. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.
Ltd. In Prakasam, information was gathered from 821 households, 689 women, and 95 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes

expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family

the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore. NFHS-5
fieldwork for Andhra Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Srikakulam. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.
Ltd. In Srikakulam, information was gathered from 874 households, 780 women, and 100 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Visakhapatnam. NFHS-5 fieldwork for
Andhra Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting
Pvt. Ltd. In Visakhapatnam, information was gathered from 869 households, 818 women, and 112 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family

the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

Andhra Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for West Godavari. NFHS-5 fieldwork for
Andhra Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting
Pvt. Ltd. In West Godavari, information was gathered from 884 households, 841 women, and 122 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.

Introduction

The National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on
population, health, and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). Like NFHS-4, NFHS-5 also
provides district-level estimates for many important indicators.

The contents of NFHS-5 are similar to NFHS-4 to allow comparisons over time. However, NFHS-5 includes
some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing
practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric,
and biochemical testing (CAB) has also been expanded to include measurement of waist and hip
circumferences, and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been
expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide
national, state/union territory (UT), and district level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey.
However, estimates of indicators of sexual behaviour; husband’s background and woman's work; HIV/AIDS
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour; and domestic violence are available only at the state/union territory (UT)
and national level.

As in the earlier rounds, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, designated the
International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, as the nodal agency to conduct NFHS-5. The main
objective of each successive round of the NFHS has been to provide high-quality data on health and family
welfare and emerging issues in this area. NFHS-5 data will be useful in setting benchmarks and examining
the progress the health sector has made over time. Besides providing evidence for the effectiveness of
ongoing programmes, the data from NFHS-5 help in identifying the need for new programmes with an area
specific focus and identifying groups that are most in need of essential services.

Four Survey Schedules - Household, Woman’s, Man’s, and Biomarker - were canvassed in local languages
using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). In the Household Schedule, information was
collected on all usual members of the household and visitors who stayed in the household the previous night,
as well as socio-economic characteristics of the household; water, sanitation, and hygiene; health insurance
coverage; disabilities; land ownership; number of deaths in the household in the three years preceding the
survey; and the ownership and use of mosquito nets. The Woman’s Schedule covered a wide variety of
topics, including the woman’s characteristics, marriage, fertility, contraception, children’s immunizations and
healthcare, nutrition, reproductive health, sexual behaviour, HIV/AIDS, women’s empowerment, and
domestic violence. The Man’s Schedule covered the man’s characteristics, marriage, his number of children,
contraception, fertility preferences, nutrition, sexual behaviour, health issues, attitudes towards gender roles,
and HIV/AIDS. The Biomarker Schedule covered measurements of height, weight, and haemoglobin levels
for children; measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and haemoglobin levels for
women age 15-49 years and men age 15-54 years; and blood pressure and random blood glucose levels for
women and men age 15 years and over. In addition, women and men were requested to provide a few
additional drops of blood from a finger prick for laboratory testing for HbA1c, malaria parasites, and Vitamin
D3.

Readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some States/UTs may have
smaller sample size. Moreover, at the time of survey, Ayushman Bharat AB-PMJAY and Pradhan Manttri
Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) were not fully rolled out and hence, their coverage may not have been
factored in the results of indicator 12 (percentage of households with any usual member covered under a
health insurance/financing scheme) and indicator 33 (percentage of mothers who received 4 or more
antenatal care check-ups).

This fact sheet provides information on key indicators and trends for Y.S.R. NFHS-5 fieldwork for Andhra
Pradesh was conducted from 2 July, 2019 to 14 November, 2019 by Sigma Research and Consulting Pvt.
Ltd. In Y.S.R., information was gathered from 910 households, 1,017 women, and 140 men.

7Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing altogether

(limiting). Specifically, women are considered to have unmet need for spacing if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either do not want to become pregnant within the next two years, or are unsure if or when they want to

become pregnant.

- Pregnant with a mistimed pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following a mistimed birth and not using contraception.

Women are considered to have unmet need for limiting if they are:

- At risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and want no (more) children.

- Pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy.

- Postpartum amenorrhoeic for up to two years following an unwanted birth and not using contraception.

Women who are classified as infecund have no unmet need because they are not at risk of becoming pregnant. Unmet need for family planning is the sum of unmet need

for spacing plus unmet need for limiting.
